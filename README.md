# Abstract

Once upon a time I stumbled upon the weird and wonderful world of Concatenative Programming. A family of programming languages unlike anything I had seen, with syntax reminiscent of 90s eurodance anthems and the wild idea that everything is a function â€” even the values!

This is the story about my journey into that world. I will take you through the history of concatenative languages, starting with Forth in the 70s, how concatenative languages work, and why they were created. I will share how learning about these languages have affected the way I program and hopefully inspire some of you to venture outside what we would consider normal programming.
