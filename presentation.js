            Its late year back in Norway. Its cold, its dark (like seriously, we
            have like 4 hours of daylight this time of year). Its the perfect
            time to dive into that Pocket-queue thats been neglegted for a year
            or so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right about now is where I would have loved to start this talk with
            me walking along the dusty ailes of a library in the dodgey part of
            my home town, but the times have moved ahead to twitter, blogposts
            and neverending pocket-queues.

            I just love the promise of this quote. It alludes to the idea that
            languages can change your perspective on programming. And that is
            just a bit magical to me. And it promises that there actually are
            languages that are different enough in and of themselves that they
            become worth knowing.

            Up first was a language called Joy. That was quite the name. It
            being all dark and bleak and cold, a little bit of Joy wouldn't
            hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a so-called Concatenative Language. A term I had never heard
            of before. I knew Functional, Object Oriented, Imperative,
            Declarative, and all these other terms. But not Concateantive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another word was also being used. Stack-based. Programming with
            stacks? It gave me some associations to assembly programming and
            other low-level things.

            The stack-based term is not undeserved. The whole state of the world
            lives in a global stack, which you interact with to do your
            programming business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pushing, popping and throwing things around on there. The functions
            in a concatenative language either puts things on the stack, takes
            things off the stack og a combination of the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is pretty much the semantics of the language summed up in
            two sentences.

            At first glance the essence of Joy seemed to be that of a
            stack-based, postfix calculator. Similar to the ones we heard of in
            university as this thing no one used anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            But surely there has to be more to it. Just postfix and a stack
            doesn't seem all that interesting. And why call it concatenative?
            There must be a deeper idea here.

            Going back to the description of Joy, theres this sentence that
            stands out: You construct programs by concatenating smaller
            programs. It sounds simple enough, programs are written left to
            right with the operation you want to do after its operands.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this also means that any two valid programs can form a new
            larger program by just placing them after one another - or
            composition by concatenation. That is some magic stuff.

            This is the magic sauce of concatenative languages. Composition
            through concatenation. This is a bit heady, so let's look at an
            example:

          <Notes>
            This is a program which figures out if the successor to a number is
            divisible by five. It is composed of five smaller programs and
            concatenated, or juxtaposed. Which is where we get the name of the
            programming language family.

            If we insert explicit composition operators here. We Start noticing

          <p>
            With the ability to keep code in lists, much in the same way as
            Lisp, we get the same code-as-data-as-code charachteristic as Lisp
            has. This is why Joy often gets called the Lisp of concatenative
            languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one crucial difference between Lisp and Joy though. The
            structure of the data is a sequence, not a tree. Because evaluation
            happens postfix everything just flattens out to a single sequence.
            Applying a quotation can almost be thought of as prepending/consing
            code to the code you are already evaluating. And this enables code
            in concatenative style to be streamed - I wonder if this is the
            reason for PostScripts design.

          </p>
          <p>
            Chuck wanted something simple and portable. Which lived close to the
            machine, but still expressive enough to get things done. Forth was
            the answer to this.

            Back in the days every computer had their own design and CPUs varied
            greatly in what kind of capabilities they shipped with. You would
            have to tweak your programs to fit a great variety of CPU
            archiectures and Chuck did not want to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer became to base the entire language on the stack, because
            that was the one commonality between CPUs.

            Back in the days, computers didnt have a lot of working memory so if
            Chuck were to skip the whole issue of assemblers and tooling it
            meant working directly with the CPU. That meant that the language he
            was making had to be simple to compile and translate to machine
            code.
          </p>
          <p>
            That meant taking away the things that made compiling hard. Like
            arity checking on operators, solved with postfix. Using space for
            token separation instead of other delimiters like braces and
            brackets, and only as few special operators as possible.

          Simplicity was the motivator for both languages. von Thun wanted to
          simplify lambda calculus and ended up taking out variables and any
          kind of explicit composition. Moore, as we shall see, had a different
          way to approach it, but the goal was still simplicity.

            There was one more crucial thing about the design decisions that
            went into Forth. It had to be simple to use, the language needed to
            scale from the very low level machine interfaces all the way up to
            the higher level.
          </p>

              You could almost call this thinking concatenatively. This way of
              working falls so naturally out of the way concatenative languages
              work, with the easy substitution and extraction of sub-programs
              for reuse or repitition.

              almost effortlessly.

              describes how it was working in an extremely facinating language,
              but because it describes the philosophy of working in Forth.

            In fact, they named their philosophy of working Factoring, after the
            act of decomposing your program into parts. And outlined some
            guidelines for when you would want to decompse your program:
          </p>
          <p>
            Remind you of something? This is basically refactoring as defined by
            Martin Fowler in 1999, only this was in 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Forth programmers would repeat this process and build a new
            layer of vocaulary which you then could further build upon.

            Being this cumbersome, you sometimes wonder if the stack-stuff is
            actually worth it. But some of the most widely used VMs today are
            based on stack-machines. This is because code for a stack-machine is
            easy to optimize, for many of the same reasons it is easy to create
            abstractions. A sequence of program can be swapped out for a more
            performant sequence yielding the same result without having to
            rewire the program.

            The end goal of this process was to build up to something which
            would explain the problem in its most precise form and using the
            language of the problem itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And new language to describe a problem will lead to better
            communication and lead to better solutions. This was even apparent
            in how Chuck Moore used specific language to describe the different
            parts of his language. Procedures, or functions, he called Words and
            modules was called Lexicons. This was to give the associations to
            natuaral language and how you would go about writing a description.
            For those who attended Felienne's keynote yesterday, this will sound
            familiar.

        <Notes>
          <p>
            The most interesting thing learned from reading Thinking Forth and
            studying concatenative languages was how this way of working
            following naturally from how the language was designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lack of syntactic control structures like blocks and variables
            with scopes, meant that extracting functionality was as simple as
            replacing sequences of words with a name for that sequence. Almost
            like we would do in writing and spoken communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working in a pure compose-mode like this is quite powerful. Just
            imagine what React unlocked for webprogrammers, or how Unix-pipes
            have inspired countless people over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that I think is the most important lesson to be learned from
            this strange looking family of languages. Design matters and it will
            affect how you work, how you play, how you learn, how you
            communicate.
